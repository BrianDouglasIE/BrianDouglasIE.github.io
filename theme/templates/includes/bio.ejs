            <p>Hi, I'm Brian. Welcome to my blog. Here I write about the things I have learned whilst creating stuff on
                the
                web.</p>
            <p>I hope that you will find something noteworthy here, that will pique your interest, and that you will
                visit
                again soon.</p>
