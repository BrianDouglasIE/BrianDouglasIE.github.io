Bun has an sqlite interface built in. It makes for some great dev-ex. One thing that ircks me when dealing with
sql and Typescript however, is that when I run queries I often have to model the db table that I am querying in
Typescript. This usually involves a manual effort, but not anymore. I have written a short script to auto
generate Typescript types for table definitions.

I introduce to you "literal-templates", a lightweight, flexible template engine for Node.js.
Offering dynamic registration and rendering of template views, includes, and helpers.

I've been thinking some more about using template strings as a view engine. This blog for
example now uses the template engine shown below. It's quite simple to implement and it's
usage in html files is super intuitive. You just need to remember that the html you are
writing will be intepretted as a template string, and you already know how to use template
strings, so there is no overhead.

Template strings in JS can be used to create a view engine without adding any extra libraries.
So if you are creating a server side js app, think before you reach for handlebars, ejs, or
god forbid pug. Not becuase those are bad, pug is, but becuase it's so easy to leverage template
strings as a view engine.

Before you pull in the next hot new validation library. Ask yourself this question. Do I need it?
The answer is no, field validation is quite easy. Let me show you how to create an extensible
object field validator.

Feature flags are simple _on_ / _off_ flags that can be used to toggle application features without needing a production release.

Strings in C. They are wonderfully intuitive and easy to work with *cough*.

No, strings in C are a nightmare. Doing simple things such as trimming the
whitespace off the start or end of a string is complicated. Because a string
is not a string it's a `char *`. Which means that if you want to do interesting
things you are going to have to get used to managing memory. Which means thinking,
and if there is one thing modern programmers hate, it's thinking.

Anyway, below I have added `ltrim_string`, `rtrim_string`, and `trim_string` methods.
I've made the code as readable as I can, and documented it with tests.

For some reason the good people at Hacker News have shadow banned my blog.
I can still post, but the post never appears to anyone else. I'm not sure
why this is the case, as one of my posts has ~350 upvotes and spent time on
the front page.

What did I do wrong Hacker News?

I've been writing a lot of C. Whilst doing so I have been questioning my sanity.
Am I an awful programmer? You know what, I think I might be.

Kudos to all those devs that created monumental feats with C. Because it is not
an easy tool to use. That said, I do enjoy writing C, just as long as I don't
have a deadline or any business critical software to deliver. But when I say enjoy, I mean
enjoyment in the sense of using a sycthe to cut a lawn, whilst my lawnmower watches on.
It's lovely using the sycthe, but at the end of the day when I am exhausted and cut
only a quarter of the grass that I could have cut with a mower in half the time, I do feel
a great sense of achievement. I'm exhausted and broken, but happy.

Most people I see coding these days use Visual Studio Code. But Visual Studio Code is
a Microsoft project that tracks your usage and does all sorts of evil corporation stuff.

But don't worry there is an actual open-source version called VSCodium. It works just as
well as the Microsoft version, without stealing your soul.

Here is a string representation of a path. But tell me, is it a directory? is it a file? maybe it's a symlink?
perhaps there is nothing there at all.

I've been working with JTE (Java Template Engine) templates in my latest Spring app. They are a joy to work with and
feel like a more _modern_ alternative to Thymeleaf templates. With Spring however there are some integrations that a
Thymeleaf user would expect, that are missing when using JTE. Automatic form error association being one. So I have
documented how to pass form errors to your jte templates below.

</div>              <i>Read more...</i>            </article>            </a>          </li>                    <li>            <a href="jte-csrf">            <article>              <h3>Add a CSRF token to HTML forms with JTE</h3>              <time datetime="16/06/2025">16/06/2025</time>              <div>
When submitting information via an HTML form, Spring Security requires the form to include a CSRF (Cross-Site Request
Forgery) token. This token is generated by the Spring app and tied to the user's session. Spring will use it to verify
that the form submission is legitimate and not malicious. The token is required on POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH requests
to protect against CSRF attacks. So when your user is submitting information, the form used to submit said information
will need to contain a valid csrf token. This means adding a hidden field to the form that contains the token. In this
post I'll demonstrate my reusable solution to this when using Spring and JTE.

I'm working on a website that functions as an index of trades people in Ireland. It allows users to register a trade
profile detailing their services. This trade profile can then be reviewed by other users. I have this functionality
pretty much built out. But until recently I had very little test data, which lead me on a journey into the world of
database seeding. Which is the generation of test data that mimics real world data. Here's how I got on.

</div>              <i>Read more...</i>            </article>            </a>          </li>                    <li>            <a href="blueprintfactory-1.0.0">            <article>              <h3>New Lib: Blueprint Factory</h3>              <time datetime="28/05/2025">28/05/2025</time>              <div>
I'm working on an app that requires a large amount of seed data. In order to achieve this I created a factory pattern
that mimics Laravel's approach. This allows objects to be generated with ease and uses Faker to supply test data. I
have extracted it into a package and uploaded it to Maven Central. I plan to use this approach in future projects.
Details of the library are below.

I've recently had the need to generate placeholder images for a webapp. User's of this app are not required
to upload a profile image, even though they can. This means that a fallback or "placeholder" image is required
for those that choose not to upload a profile image. To facilitate this I developed a neat little package that
can be reused in any app. The details of which are below.

Let's say we have a request that fetches a post stored in the database. That request may need
to alter the fetched post in some way. Before the post is altered various checks may need to
happen, such as an ownership check. But we want to avoid each check fetching the same post
from the database. This is when a cache that is scoped to a request's life cycle comes in handy.

CPU branch prediction is when the CPU tries to guess the outcome of a conditional
operation, eg: an `if` statement, before it is executed. If it guesses correct then
the CPU can continue executing instructions without interuption.

When working with pixel art it is common to create a virtual screen size. For example
if my sprites are 16x16 pixels and my game world is 256x256. I would want to scale the
size up to fit my computer's screen size. If the art was not scaled it would look
really tiny, on a 1920x1080 monitor.

When working on a codebase with a number of other developers migrations can cause
database conflicts. One simple step to stop migrations failing when switching
between development branches is to add `IF NOT EXISTS` when creating a table.

There are lot's of occasions where I see SQL table definitions that contain

I created an interactive demo using the rules that exists for it, using Go and Raylib.

A database migrator applies database migrations. These are usually SQL scripts that
update the version of a database. They can be applied and reverted. Allowing for db
versions to be rolled back and pushed forward.

As a fun exercise I implemented a rudimentary Pong clone using Raylib and Go.

I've been watching [@Vercidium](https://www.youtube.com/@Vercidium)'s awesome content on YouTube. His videos are all
about performance optimization in regards to game development, and I learned a nifty performance optimization for my
JS code as a result.

When sharing an article on social media you will see a preview. The preview uses the html `og:image` meta tag. In this
article I will demonstrate how I generate a unique `og:image` for each of my blog posts.

Please! when you are writing tests try to limit each test case to one `expect`.
Let's refactor the monstrosity below to understand why fewer expects and more
tests are better.

Slugs make a URL look legit. No one wants to click on a link that reads like `https://mysite.com/blog/1`. I'd definitely get hacked if I clicked that. But what if it read `https://mysite.com/blog/1/some-awesome-content`. Now that looks trustworthy. I'm definitely gonna see some awesome content if I click that link.

This is a step-by-step guide on how to seed your database with Irish Counties grouped by their Province.
