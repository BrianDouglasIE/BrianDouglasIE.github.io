Where is the EU tech industry? Why do we use the software products of American giants like google, amazon, and facebook.
When we could use "local" EU software.

It's March 2025 and the US is imposing trade tariffs on the EU. Which as an EU citizen makes me think "screw you, I'll shop local".
But in regards to tech this is somewhat difficult as the US tech industry is much stronger than that of the EU. But it doesn't
have to be. The EU should end it's reliance on US tech.

Luckily there is a website called [European Alternatives](https://european-alternatives.eu) that provides a list of EU based alternatives
to popular non EU software. You should check it out and discover some hidden gems. Right now I am using the 
[Vivaldi web browser](https://vivaldi.com) along with [Startpage](https://www.startpage.com) a Dutch search engine.
They are excellent alternatives to the tech giant offerings. 

By using this alternative software, you support the creation of jobs, encourage competition, and end your reliance on evil monopolies.

Make the switch today, use a European Alternative.
