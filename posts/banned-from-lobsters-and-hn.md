Banned from lobste.rs and Hacker News

For some reason the good people at Hacker News have shadow banned my blog.
I can still post, but the post never appears to anyone else. I'm not sure
why this is the case, as one of my posts has ~350 upvotes and spent time on
the front page.

What did I do wrong Hacker News?

## Lobsters

I'm also totally banned from lobte.rs, they have block my domain and everything.
Why? becuase I posted a link to my own blog. What a cardinal sin, banned for life
not comeback. The ironic thing there is one of my posts was very popular, and also
spend time on their front page. Earning them valuable clicks and discussions. How
did they repay the favour? by banning me from posting and my blog from ever appearing
on their site again. Thank lobste.rs.

## Where else to post?

Don't know, the internet is basically just bots now. I remember years ago, let's say 10-12
years ago. I could post anywhere and real people would see, share, and discuss the content.
That is not the case anymore. If you are not instantly shadow banned now, your content will
drown under a flood of bot traffic and garbage.

Dead is the age of the internet troll, long live the bot.
