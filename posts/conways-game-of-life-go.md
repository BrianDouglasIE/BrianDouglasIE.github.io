Conway's _Game of Life_ is a relatively straight forward cellular automata.
I created an interactive demo using the rules that exists for it, using Go and Raylib.

Wikipedia tells me that these are the rules by which a cell can be determined to be _alive_ or _dead_.
 - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
 - Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
 - Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
 - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

With this in mind I was able to create the below demo. I added interactivity by allowing the user to click
a cell to toggle it's state between _dead_ and _alive_. Pressing the up arrow key runs the next cycle.
