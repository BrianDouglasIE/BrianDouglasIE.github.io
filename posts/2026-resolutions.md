2025 was a super busy year for me. Some of the highlights being, my wife is now pregnant (due date 02/01/2026),
moving house (now on a 300 acre farm), becoming a part time farmer (150 sheep, inherited from my father in law).
And on the tech side, as my techy life is the focus of this blog, an awful lot of wheel spin.

<!-- more -->

By wheel spin I mean, starting projects and not finishing them, lot's of personal development, and exploration into
different tech, AI assisted ofcourse. So I did a lot of programming in 2025, but didn't really commit to one thing
long enough to deliver anything notable, other than a few java maven packages. As mentioned a lot of the exploration was
AI assisted. LLMs are my go to search engine now. Google's search result quality (and all the others) suck. There was
a time when I could "google" a thing and get the exact result I wanted. Now I just get seo hacks, and crap content.
LLMs don't suffer from this at the minute, I predict they will eventually have the same fate when advertising gets a
hold of them. But for now they are great. I ask some model to show me a quad tree, boom, heres a perfect quadtree. What's
not to like. Will it take my job? well I'm unemployed at the minute, so I think it already has...

In reality no I don't believe it will. It certainly speeds up aspects of the job of software engineering. But writing
code has never really been the bottle neck. Most of my time at the office is spent in meetings, arguing, offering
opinions, and trying to understand the bizarre social heirarchies. Text generating LLMs don't speed this part of the job up.
In fact I feel they have slowed that side down, by adding an extra layer of bullshit. Anyway I digress.

In 2026 I want to break the trend of not delivering and flip flopping between projects. I will stick to one tech stack and finish
the projects I start. That is my techy new year's resolution.

## Last year's predictions

> Max Verstappen will win his fifth world title and sign a deal with Mercedes. The world won't end. My family will
> expand, and so will my waistline.

Aside from the Verstappen predictions, everything else was spot on. The world hasn't ended. Our second daughter is
on the way, and I'm fatter than ever.

## Predictions for 2026

The AI bubble will pop (A great tool, not the sci-fy nonsense that was touted and paid for). The US will invade some random country
to take the heat off it's economic stress. The EU will make some more bizarre self destructive decisions. But the world
still won't end. My family will be happier than ever, and my waistline will shrink.
