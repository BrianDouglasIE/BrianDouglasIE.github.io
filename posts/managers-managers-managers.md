Today was my last day at work. I work as a short term contractor, although sometimes it's not
short term. I onced worked a rolling 6 month contract for 4 years. It paid for my house and
wedding, those were the days. Often I am happy to accept extensions. But sometimes I don't.
When I don't it's always been down to the same cause. Managers or mismanagement.

<!-- more -->

This was particularly prevalent in my last role. I worked on a delivery team of 8. Which is quite
a big team. You would imagine maybe there was 4 devs, 2 qa, and 2 manager types. Well that was not
the case. I was the sole developer, and worked with one qa. Leaving 6 "managers", I put manager in
quotation marks as their title may not have been "manager". Actually, here is the breakdown:

 - Product Manager  (Seemed to be in charge)
 - Product Owner    (Disciple of Product Manager)
 - Project Manager  (Basically a scrum master)
 - Business Analyst (Not sure, wrote jira stoies)
 - Tech Team Lead   (Semi technical, didn't really contribute)
 - QA Team Lead     (Joined meetings, didn't contribute)

The product in question was a website prompt that would interupt a user on an "email us" form and
suggest a link from a list of frequently asked questions. It used **AI**, magic **AI**, buzzword
of the minute **AI**. Basically I took the query and used natural language processing to find if
one of the list of FAQs matched the query. No big deal, delivered in a week sort of feature.
DELIVERED IN A WEEK SORT OF FEATURE. Well no. The project is in it's second year.

It's not in it's second year because it isn't live. It is, it's delivered. But the managers are still
managing. They are looking for ways to improve it's _performance_. To find out more key metrics.
To get more funding (3.75 million a year!), so they can continue the project. Despite the feature 
long being delivered. And, to be fair, the business are delighted. They have delivered an **AI** 
product. wow. They are ahead of the curve when it comes to tech, they are basically bleeding edge.
I kid you not, they even got an award, at an award ceremony. Attended by people how were not even 
involved in the project. They got to dress up fancy and go on stage to accept some crystal ware.

So why did I decide to leave such a successful team? well because my soul was destroyed. The reality
is, it's a small feature of a website. It took me a few days to implement, and I've been in meetings
about it ever since. Meetings that go nowhere, because there are two many managers. And when there is
more than one manager, and layers of management above them, no decision can ever be made. Teams just
exist in a state of perpetual wheel spinning. Lot's of meetings, no outcomes. Lot's of being busy but
not achieving anything. Honestly my head is wrecked. But I had to stay to earn money to provide for my
family. I did offer my help to other teams, but a _manager_ told me that it would make the delivery
team I was supposed to be on look bad. As it might seem they didn't have enough work for me... they
didn't!

The funny thing is, today is my last day. And there is no replacement. So the team will now consist of
6 managers, and a qa. So not only did I feel redundant, I was redundant.

I'm now going to take some time off, and work on some products of my own. I'm going to give myself 6 
months at least. This will help me build up my confidence to re-enter the workplace, get rid of the cyncism
that has built up, and develop my skills again. I've been working non stop for 15 years. So it's a well 
earned break. It comes at a good time. We've just finished building our house, and my wife is due to deliver 
our second child in December. I am a happy man.
