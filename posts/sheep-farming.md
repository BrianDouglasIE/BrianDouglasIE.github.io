"Part-time sheep farmer", that is my new job title.

<!-- more -->

Things have been super hectic over the last few months. We have just moved into
our new home next door to my wife's dad. The house was built in 1995 but never
finished. So we decided that this year we would finish it off and move up.
The house is on Tony's 300 acre sheep farmer, in the bluestack mountains of Donegal.
It's a remote location. Our nearest neighbour is about a mile away as the crow flies.
It is one of the most beautiful places you could ever expect to live in.

As part of the renovations I have taken on board the painting, kitchen installation, and
all the other unspecialised jobs, of which there are many. In order to get these done 
before christmas, when our second child is due, I've resigned from my job as a software
engineer. Even though I am unemployed, I've been working harder than ever. Renovating the
house as well as taking over duties on Tony's sheep farm. He is getting up there in age
and has been struggling with the more physical aspects of the farm. So he's glad for the help.

We have over 150 sheep, and I thoroughly enjoy taking care of them, getting them in off the hill,
and administering medecine when needed. It's a great life. Modern technology has made it some what
easier. For example, on Monday I used a drone to find 5 missing sheep up the hill. I then spent 4
hours running them down off the hill and into a field. This was fantastic exercise, I was exhausted
afterward.

We moved in 2 weeks ago, and life up the hill has been great. I can feel the _stress_ of life
leaving my body. This stress has been accumulating over the past few years as I have been working
non-stop without a holiday. It had to be done, I had to get a secure place for my family to live
and keep the savings high, as we await our second child.

I will return to writing code soon. But not employment. I've decided to take some time out and 
concentrate on the farm. So I predict it will be 3 days farming a week for the next year, while
I learn the trade and develop into a proper sheperd. In regards to _code_, I have lot's of ideas
I want to pursue. All of which I will post about here. I hope to start streaming in the new year.
Mainly to put pressue on myself to concentrate on programming.

A new chapter is starting for me and my family, I'm excited.
