Phase one for day 6 only. Phase 2 beat me. Spent over an hour on it, but the left
vs right justifying of numbers got me. I may come back to it, but I've spent all
the time I want to on it tonight.

```python
import traceback

result = 0
try:
    with open("d6.txt", "r") as f:
        lines = [line for line in f.readlines()]
        symbols = [v.strip() for v in lines[-1] if v.strip()]
        results = []

        # phase 1
        for numbers in lines[:-1]:
            numbers = [int(n) for n in numbers.split(" ") if n.strip()]
            if not len(results):
                for n in numbers:
                    results.append(n)
            else:
                for i in range(len(numbers)):
                    n = numbers[i]
                    if symbols[i] == '*':
                        results[i] *= n
                    elif symbols[i] == '+':
                        results[i] += n
        result = sum(results)
except Exception as e:
    traceback.print_exc()

print(result)
```
