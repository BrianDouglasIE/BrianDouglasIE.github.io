I joined x.com and followed lot's of influencial programmers. I tried sharing some of my stuff, etc...

But it gave me no joy. It just kinda wore me out. I remember when social media was young and interesting.
Now it really does just seem like a bot mine, and an echo chamber for the opinions you chose to hear.

Well as it gave me no joy, I simply deleted it. Once again I am social media less. And that makes me happy.
