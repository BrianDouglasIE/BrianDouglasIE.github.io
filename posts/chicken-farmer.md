I set myself a goal, make a game in 3 hours. The results, a snake
clone where you play a farmer collecting eggs that turn into chickens.

## Implementation

The game is written in vanilla js and doesn't use any libraries. It's all rendered via
the canvas api. Using the techniques I mentioned in ["useful-image-data-methods"](/useful-image-data-methods/).

I made the sound effects myself. I bet you thought it was a really chicken and duck.

## Play the game

You can play the game at [/games/chicken-farmer/](/games/chicken-farmer/).

## Read the source code

You can read the ugly source code at [BrianDouglasIE/chicken-farmer](https://github.com/BrianDouglasIE/chicken-farmer).

It was written very quickly, so give me some slack.
