Please, whatever you do, do not write any code.

Only the LLM can be trusted to write code.
Caveat, only an LLM owned by a trusted and truth seeking organisation like Google, Microsoft, or Skynet should
be used. Only the likes of these can be trusted to create for you. Only the likes of these can be trusted
to provide you with knowledge. Only the likes of these can supply unbiased truth based information.
Before taking the risk of endeavouring to create, please first sign up to a paid subscription from
the aforementioned truth seekers. Their machines are enlightened, and can create for you. No independent thought
is necessary, the machine will do this for you.

If you are a programmer whatever you have learned to date is now redundant. It should be your task to, _as quickly as possible_,
unlearn any programming knowledge that you possess. It would be a dramatic error of judgement for you to continue to enhance any of your
coding/programming skills. Please instead let the machine write code for you. Even better, let the machine think for you to.

There is no need for you to learn, the LLM has learned for you. There is no need for you to think, the LLM has thought for you.
There is no need for you to create, the LLM will create for you.

There is no need for you.
