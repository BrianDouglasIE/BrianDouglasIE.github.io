Last year I was all over the place. Writing lot's of different languages, exploring new stacks,
and generally getting nothing done. 2026 will be all about "focus". By focus I mean, one stack, 
finished projects, and narrowed scope.

<!-- more -->

So what stack? what projects?... Well this is a tough one for any software engineer. Especially
now that LLMs make programming languages very accessible. But I need to just pick one and run 
with it. When it comes to it, it doesnt really matter how you did a thing, as long as you did
it. So with that in mind... *Javascript* is going to be the language of choice.

Lot's of people are snobs about it, but the thing that swayed me to commiting to javascript and
javascript only for 2026 is that I can make a game/demo/app and share it straight away. When I 
play games on itch.io I always filter by "browser games". Because I don't want to download and
run a game on my PC. I'm happy to play in the browser, which means running javascript. It's also
allows me to quickly create a web app and throw it online. Which is important as the projects
I am looking to work on this year are web-centric.

I'll be starting off the year by creating a web version of the card game _Scoundrel_. Which is a 
sort of like a dungeon crawling version of solitaire. I'm between two minds about using a hybrid
css/canvas approach or full canvas for the rendering of the game. But it's something I can experiment
with.

So that's it decided. Javascript, and javascript only none of this mircosoftscript (typescript) nonsense,
will be my focus for 2026. Other languages may be better at certain things, but I don't care. There
comes a time when choice is just a hindrance. I will commit to this tool, and master it over the
coming months. 

I will be focused, and focus will yield results.
